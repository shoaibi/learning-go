## What is this repo about?
As a beginner of golang I am documenting my learnings in the best possible form e.g. code, so I can come back and use as a reference.

## But you did it wrong
That wouldn't be a first, specially with me being this new to golang. Let me know what was wrong by making a Pull Request :) 

## What about tests, parsing, ...
A lot of topics are still missing where I need to learn more and document. [Here](https://github.com/shoaibi/playing-with-go-crawler/blob/master/TODO.md) is a short list of things I still need to learn/document.

## Debugging
For this one, I created [a separate repos](https://github.com/shoaibi/playing-with-go-debugger).
